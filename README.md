# Data Structures Library

This Java project demonstrates fundamental data structures through interactive console demos, showcasing a mix of:

- Using Java’s built-in classes (e.g., `Stack`, `Queue`, `TreeSet`)
- Implementing core data structures manually (e.g., singly linked list)

## Features

- **Array Demo:** Basic array usage with user input.
- **Singly Linked List:** Custom-built linked list with insertion and traversal.
- **Stack & Queue:** Implemented using Java’s standard library classes.
- **Binary Tree:** Demo using Java’s `TreeSet` for binary tree operations.
- Interactive menu-driven interface allowing users to explore each data structure.

## Object-Oriented Design

- Each data structure is encapsulated in its own class with a `run(Scanner sc)` method to handle interaction.
- Demonstrates encapsulation, modularity, and abstraction principles.
- Easy to extend with new data structures by adding new classes.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Compile all `.java` files:
   ```bash
   javac DataStrucProject.java
